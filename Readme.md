# Whats app form builder SaaS (Trying out real SaaS)

### I am trying to build a real SaaS project where business can create forms and customers can answer them step by step via WhatsApp chat. The goal is to learn backend backend development while building out real world application.

## 🍄 Current Focus:
    - Node.js file handling (TXT vs JSON)
    - Understanding structured vs unstructured data
    - Preparing for PostgreSQL + Prisma
    - Learning API integrations and webhooks

## 🍄 Repository Structure:
``backend/learning/reading_files`` → Node.js experiments, file handling, API tests
``docs/*`` → notes, ideas
``Readme.md/*`` → Project explanation and progress updates

## Note
This is a learning-first project.  
I'm updating the code and notes gradually and documenting the journey publicly.
